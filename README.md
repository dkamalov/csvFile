In this I will document what I did throughout this lab. 

Initially I was having an extremely hard time trying to find something to download. I tried many csv's on many platforms and the only one that worked was the City of Chicagos data.
For some reason any other option using both curl and wget only gave my part of the data/none of it. It was very strange and I will be looking into it more as I think that it's useful.
This might be because with Chicago I used the link instead of the website which would be the reason. However, I also used Github raw which should've worked as well. 
In any case for task 1 I downloaded public servant information for the City of Chicago. Then I organized it by salary which is column 7. 

For task 2 I did that but put it into a shell script along with the log files showing the cmds work. 

For task 3 I decided to do an occurence counter to see how many times a word appears in a given document. I always liked these, especially with classical books because it was funny. 
It could also be useful as well to data analysts. I made the $word and $filename like that so that any word/file an work. 

For Reference :
                  Shell Script Lab 5 is the log for the first task.
                  DAMIRLOG is the log for the final task. 
                  Thank you.
